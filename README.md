OIMUserDefinedFieldUtility
==========================
Version: Oracle Identity Manager 11g R2

- This utility creates a user defined field (UDF) XML file based on the data the user provides in the CSV file.
- The generated XML file can imported to an Oracle Identity Manager environment via Deployment Manager.
- Encrypted UDFs are not supported for this utility (Also, OIM does not allow you to export encrypted UDFs).
- List of Values (LOV) UDFs will not be created if the assigned lookup does not exist or there are no entries in the lookup.
